It is said to be the temple of Goddess Luxmi. The school plays a significant part in shaping the future personality of a child. A good school is a centre for learning good habits at a tender age which has an everlasting impact. Our country is not fortunate enough to provide good schooling to all the school going children. The schools are generally not provided with food facilities like good buildings, teachers, equipment and the like. Only a few schools in  big cities are good centre of learning and education. The schools in rural areas and small towns presents a very bad picture resulting  in very poor performance of students. lot of improvement is required in this field, then only can we boast of being a developing country.

I study in Global Indian International School,Kuala Lumpur.It is a great school and i love to study here.The infrastructure here is really good,there is a 4 storey building for the CBSE students and a different building for the Cambridge students.Each floor consists of different classes,there is also a art room,dance room and music room on the top floor.
This showcases that GIIS KL gives a lot attention to extracurricular activities while at the same time academics is also given the same weightage. This is not seen in every school,and i consider myself lucky to be in this school.

In my school there is a playground in front of the building.Children enjoy playing all sorts of game in the playground.There is also a basketball court,it is a great place to improve your basketball moves.The school has another court where students usually play badminton and throwball.
There is a canteen which serves delicious food to the students,it is a great place to have your lunch.
The school also have audio visual rooms where most of the dance and music competitions are held.Each class consists of a speaker which informs you about some important news.

The most important part of a school the teachers!.There are incredible teachers in this school,and i am blessed to recieve education from these teachers.Teachers have the very important responsibility of shaping the lives of young, impressionable children. With this responsibility comes great pride and joy. Therefore all teachers should strive for what can be considered to be a "good teacher." A good teacher can be defined as someone who always pushes students to want to do their best while at the same time trying to make learning interesting as well as creative.
The teachers in giis will help you with anything.They will never turn you away.Teachers are supportive and friendly.
This school has been a great help in my education years,i will always remember it.
