      <H3>LIFE AT GIIS</H3>
      <P>At GIIS, we believe in working with students to create future global citizens who are not only well educated, but also well-rounded.

To help reach that goal, we divide all of our campuses into four houses. Students are placed into a house, and inter- and intra-school competitions 
allow them to compete against other houses in academics, performing arts, fine arts, literature, and sports. These school and house activities help students 
showcase their learning while also developing a sense of teamwork and pride in individual accomplishments.</P>

       <H4>EXTRA CIRRICULAR ACTIVITIES</H4>
       <P>Extra-curricular activities are those activities, often sports-based, that take place outside of the GIIS classroom, helping students develop their 
       personalities and physical aptitude, which is a crucial part of our Nine Gems programme. Students who show particular talent in these extracurricular 
       activities may participate in the Gold Squad Programme, which provides additional, intensive training under skilled coaches.</P>
