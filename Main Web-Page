School helps guide youngsters though the establishment of a daily routine, which is of utmost importance as we direct them toward the workplace, and as they become productive members of society.

      <H3>LIFE AT GIIS</H3>
      <P>At GIIS, we believe in working with students to create future global citizens who are not only well educated, but also well-rounded.

To help reach that goal, we divide all of our campuses into four houses. Students are placed into a house, and inter- and intra-school competitions allow them to compete against other houses in academics, performing arts, fine arts, literature, and sports. These school and house activities help students showcase their learning while also developing a sense of teamwork and pride in individual accomplishments.</P>

       <H4>EXTRA CIRRICULAR ACTIVITIES</H4>
       <P>Extra-curricular activities are those activities, often sports-based, that take place outside of the GIIS classroom, helping students develop their personalities and physical aptitude, which is a crucial part of our Nine Gems programme. Students who show particular talent in these extracurricular activities may participate in the Gold Squad Programme, which provides additional, intensive training under skilled coaches.</P>

        <H2>PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENT</H2>
        <P>GIIS offers a warm, secure and comfortable setting for students leaving the familiarity of their homes. Bright colors, open spaces, green lawns, and well-lit classrooms are conducive to individual instruction as well as group work and peer teaching. Classrooms also have locker facilities to save children from carrying books back and forth</P>
<ARTICLE>
<ARTICLE>
        <H3>CIRRICULUM</H3>
        <P>While every outstanding school has a comprehensive and meaningful curriculum, our internationally renowned GIIS Nine Gems model elevates learning to another level. In addition to carefully constructed syllabi, we also offer enrichment opportunities, including self-learning, peer-learning and group learning, to further engage students.</P>
<ARTICLE>
<ARTICLE>
        <H4>FACULTY</H4>
        <P>The adults who interact with the students are a key differentiator within any schooling system. At GIIS, our teachers are the medium through which we nurture happiness in our students. Because we believe that each of them must understand our unique philosophy, all candidates undergo a rigorous recruitment process which factors in not only academic qualifications and experience, but also attitude. Our staff members have the desire to teach, but they also have the desire to learn -- not only from other adults, but from the students, too.</P>
<ARTICLE>
<ARTICLE>
        <H5>ATMOSPHERE</H5>
        <P>The atmosphere our students dwell in helps them in becoming emotionally secure and balance, and allows them to process and understand a lot of information happening around them. Students are exposed to a judicial mix of scholastic and co-scholastic life enriching activities that help them enjoy multiple aspects of learning, so much that coming to school every day is like an exciting journey for them to start and gain wisdom.</P>
<ARTICLE>
<ARTICLE>
        <H6>TREATMENT</H6>
        <P>Students love doing things when they know what they are doing and believe in it. We at GIIS believe in treating every child as a distinct individual having an unmatchable personality and talents to nurture. Each GIIS campus works on various dimensions of a child so that they enjoy every part of schooling.</P>

<B>At GIIS, an indication that we’re succeeding at what we do is ample recognition by coveted national
 and international organisations including Asia Pacific Quality Organisation, Institute of Directors, 
Spring Singapore, and Indian Merchants Chamber among many others.</B>
<BR><BR>
Since our founding in 2002, we have been committed to providing comprehensive educational opportunities
 to our students. Towards this end, we have undertaken conscious steps to instill efficiency and 
effectiveness across all our operations, including management processes, operational methodologies,
 and curriculum delivery.

The ultimate result? Not only have we created and fostered a process-driven culture, but we’ve
 also been able to synchronise and replicate these strong, benchmarked practices across all of
 our campuses.

It’s particularly significant as well as gratifying to all members of the GIIS community
 -- including management, staff, parents, and students alike -- to be honoured for our collective
 and ongoing efforts.

Our dedication to a well-rounded and holistic approach for nurturing young minds for a better tomorrow
 is no better signified than by the fact that we have been honoured with several national and 
international awards for innovation and excellence in school education in such a short period of time.
