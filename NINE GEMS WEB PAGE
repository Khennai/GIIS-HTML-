<font size=4 color=tomato>
<p>
The award-winning Nine Gems model recognizes that success in the contemporary world relies not only on cognizance, but also on creativity, entrepreneurship, 
and the ability to explore.

What makes Nine Gems truly innovative is its balanced, age-appropriate, and adaptive approach which allows it to evolve with students as they grow. While 
academic excellence is emphasized at every level, the focus is placed on universal values, ethics, discipline, creativity and personality development in the 
initial years, before shifting to academic achievement, leadership and entrepreneurial skills, and key competencies for vocational and career progression during
the secondary and high school years.
