          <H6>PROVIDING A PLATFORM FOR COLLABORATION</H6>
<P>With the addition of myGIIS to the GIIS program -- parents, teachers, students and staff have a centralised channel through which they can better 
collaborate to ensure every student’s success. Parents can provide feedback through the portal, and teachers can share instant information about behaviour and 
achievement. Students know what their parents and teachers are seeing and saying, so they are motivated to work harder and achieve further. Staff members can
keep everyone well informed about potential changes to the schedule and share announcements that need to be made.</P>
